I am a third year PhD student at UMass Amherst, working with professor [Fatima Anwar](https://people.umass.edu/fanwar/). My areas of interest are security and privacy of distributed machine learning systems. Prior to joining UMass, I completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering from the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk) at the [National University of Sciences and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk) in 2021.

I enjoy reading, cooking, table tennis and most of all, playing Dota2!
